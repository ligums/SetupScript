# SetupScript

Welcome to **SetupScript** – a personal automation tool I’ve built to streamline and simplify the process of setting up environments. Whether you're creating a new virtual machine, provisioning a server, or spinning up a fresh development setup, this script is designed to make the process fast, easy, and consistent.

## My Use Case  
I created this script to automate the repetitive and sometimes tedious process of setting up virtual machines and environments for both personal and development use. It’s great for ensuring that every system I create starts with a clean and consistent setup.

### What It Does:
- Installs essential packages and dependencies.
- Configures system settings and environment variables.
- Sets up version control and configuration management tools.
- Provides the option to install custom tools and applications (personalized to my workflow).

## TL;DR
I use AI to create scripts that automate the setup of environments, making it faster and more efficient. I gather all necessary commands along with their documentation to ensure everything works as expected.
